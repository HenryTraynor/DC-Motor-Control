# DC-Motor-Control
Converting a DC motor into a stepper with an optical encoder

Note that the circuit diagram designed in Fritzing is not a perfect representation of the actual circuit. Fritzing did not have the correct motor driver or optical encoder in their parts library and I did not have the time to model them in Illustrator.
